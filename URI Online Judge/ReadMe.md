In order to improve my problem solving skills, I coded several exercises at Uri Online Judge, 
which is a platform that allows the submission of solutions in different languages, in addition to having a wide range of problem 
categories, for example; beginner, strings, structures, among others. 

Note: Python 3 and C++ code is used here.
